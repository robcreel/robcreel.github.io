## Home


I am a Data Analytics Engineer with a master’s degree in mathematics and strong proficiency in R, Python, and SQL. I'm seeking a mid-level to senior Data Analytics Engineer role at a late stage startup in the city of Chicago with a dedicated data team and a strong culture of team cohesion and accomplishment.

## About

Who am I?

I love helping people. My passions are math and data, but when I am not managing data pipelines or building dashboards, I enjoy brewing coffee and taking photographs.

My area of focus is listening and engaging those who need value out of data. I meet people where they are and work collaboratively to create a path to value from the givens (the data) which has buy-in from all parties.

### E-commerce Product Data Health Dashboard
This dashboard served to benchmark the health of the product data for Culitrade, an e-commerce marketplace for dealerships of restaurant supply and equipment.  The dashboard highlights the product records in the database (Oracle's NetSuite ERP solution) and how many records were ready to display on the web site.  The information is organized by manufacturer and by dealer, and has been anonymized as the data were proprietary.

### CAMS Attendance Digest
At East-West University, where I taught math for nearly a decade, we used the classroom management tool CAMS. It produced attendance report PDFs which listed static, raw data and were difficult to glean patterns from. This application converts these PDF reports from CAMS into a useful, digestible HTML format.
