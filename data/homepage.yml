  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I love helping people.</strong> My passions are math and data, but when I am 
    not managing data pipelines or building dashboards, I enjoy brewing coffee 
    and taking photographs. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> is listening and engaging those who need 
    value out of data.  I meet people where they are and work collaboratively to 
    create a path to value from the givens (the data) which has buy-in from all 
    parties.
